I_CLabel_pair_.nsv: newline delimited list of cluster-pairs for use with I_AB_C_absZ_.tsv, etc.. Should be identical to E_CLabel_pair_.nsv.
E_AB_C_absZ_.tsv: tab delimited array of cluster-pairs (rows) by covariate (columns). Each array entry indicates the absolute-value of the z-score associated with the (raw) differential-expression of that particular covariate-rank over that cluster pair.
